# Setting Up JavaScript Development Environment

Follow these steps to set up your JavaScript development environment:


1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

    Download and install Visual Studio Code, a lightweight and powerful code editor.

2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

    Download and install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager) to manage your JavaScript dependencies.

3. Install [Code Runner extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) (On Windows)

    This extension allows you to run JavaScript code directly within VS Code. This step is optional for other operating systems.
